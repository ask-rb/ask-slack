# ask-slack — Uslack Service Context

## Purpose

Service context gem for Uslack. Provides three files:
- `context.rb` — metadata for the system prompt (API docs, auth instructions, quick-start code snippets)
- `client.rb` — authenticated API client helper
- `error_guide.rb` — structured error knowledge for agents

No tool classes. The agent reads the context from the system prompt, writes Ruby code using the `client` helper, and executes it with the `Code` tool from `ask-tools-shell`.

## Dependencies

- **Runtime:**
  - `ask-auth` (for `Ask::Auth.resolve(:service_token)`)
  - `Uslack` API client gem (e.g., `slack-ruby-client`, `notion-ruby`, `linear-ruby`)
- **Build/test:** minitest, mocha, rake, vcr, webmock
- **This gem MUST wait until `ask-auth` is built, tested, and released.** The client helper depends on `Ask::Auth.resolve`.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Define the gem scaffold
- `lib/ask-slack.rb` — entry point
- `lib/ask/slack.rb` — module
- `lib/ask/slack/version.rb`
- `lib/ask/slack/context.rb` — metadata constants
- `lib/ask/slack/client.rb` — authenticated client helper
- `lib/ask/slack/error_guide.rb` — structured error knowledge
- `ask-slack.gemspec` — depends on `ask-auth`, the service's official Ruby client

### 2. Research the service's API
- Find the official API docs URL
- Find if there's an OpenAPI spec
- Identify the auth mechanism (API key, OAuth, personal token)
- Identify the official Ruby client gem
- Determine common operations agents would need
- Map common error responses and their meanings

### 3. Build context.rb
Define constants following the `ask-github` pattern: `DESCRIPTION`, `DOCS_URL`, `OPENAPI_URL` (if available), `AUTH_NAME`, `AUTH_HOW`, `GEM_NAME`, `GEM_DOCS`, `QUICK_START`.

### 4. Build client.rb
- `Ask::Uslack.client` returns an authenticated client
- Resolves token via `Ask::Auth.resolve(:service_token)`
- Raises `Ask::Auth::MissingCredential` with instructions if no token found
- Configures sensible defaults (pagination, timeout, user agent)

### 5. Build error_guide.rb
- Map of common error patterns
- Rate limit info
- Pagination info
- Common HTTP status codes and their meanings

### 6. Test coverage
- Test context constants are accessible and correct
- Test client returns authenticated client
- Test client raises appropriate errors when credentials missing or invalid
- Test error guide maps are accurate

### 7. README
- Quick start: `Ask::Uslack.client` and writing agent code
- Auth setup instructions
- Common usage patterns
- How to develop and test locally

## What "Done" Means

- `Ask::Uslack.client` returns authenticated API client
- Context constants provide all metadata an agent needs
- Error guide provides actionable recovery info
- Tests pass with mocked credentials and API responses
- Following the `ask-github` template exactly (it's the reference implementation)
- README documents auth setup and common patterns

## Release Checklist (Required for v0.1.0)

Before declaring this gem done and releasing v0.1.0, verify:

- [] All tests pass with >90% coverage
- [] Every public API method has documentation (yardoc or inline comments)
- [] README is complete: installation, quick start, configuration, development
- [] CHANGELOG.md exists with an entry for v0.1.0
- [] All code is committed and pushed to github.com/ask-rb/ask-slack
- [] Gem builds without errors: gem build *.gemspec
- [] Gem is released as a private gem (see guides/RELEASING.md when available)
- [] A consumer app can install, require, and use the gem with no errors
- [] Thread-safety verified (registry, config, client construction)
- [] Error messages are helpful and actionable

## What Done Means for v0.1.0

The gem reaches v0.1.0 when:
- All implementation steps above are complete and tested
- The gem is released on GitHub Packages as a private gem
- A real consumer can install it with gem install or Bundler
- A consumer script can require it and use its full public API
- The README provides enough information for someone unfamiliar to get started in 5 minutes
- The CHANGELOG documents what v0.1.0 delivers

## Development Workflow

### Git conventions
- Follow the git-workflow skill for branch naming, commit messages, and PR structure.
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`.
- One logical change per commit. No "fixup" or "wip" commits on main.
- Commit messages must be one direct sentence describing the change.

### Reference projects
Study existing implementations for patterns and conventions:

- **ask-tools-shell** — extract from `ruby_llm-conductor/lib/ruby_llm/conductor/tools/`
- **ask-agent** — port from `ruby_llm-conductor/` (session, loop, tool_executor, compactor, etc.)
- **ask-rails** — transform from `solid_agents/` (railtie, generators, persistence)
- **ask-openai, ask-anthropic** — study `ruby_llm/lib/ruby_llm/providers/` for wire formats and streaming patterns
- **ask-openai** — also study `llm-proxy/lib/llm_proxy/protocols/` for OpenAI protocol conversion
- **General patterns** — study `pi/packages/ai/src/providers/` for lazy loading, registration, and protocol families
- **Test patterns** — study `ruby_llm/spec/` for VCR cassette structure and integration testing patterns
- **ask-github** — reference implementation for service context gems; follow its three-file pattern

### Testing
- Use Minitest (not RSpec) — consistent with the ask-rb ecosystem.
- Unit tests for every public method (normal path + edge cases + error cases).
- Integration tests with VCR cassettes for any gem that calls external APIs.
- Run the full suite before every commit: `bundle exec rake test`.
